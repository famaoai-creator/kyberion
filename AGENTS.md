# Kyberion Operating Guide

Binding rules and lifecycle for AI agents working in this repository. **Read this first, every session.**
Concepts are intentionally not explained here — follow the `→` links when you need the *why*.

> **Canonical file**: `AGENTS.md`. `CLAUDE.md`, `CODEX.md`, `GEMINI.md` are symlinks — edit here only.
> **Language**: rules in English; phase & onboarding docs in Japanese ([policy](./docs/DOCUMENTATION_LOCALIZATION_POLICY.md)).
> **First-time setup**: [docs/INITIALIZATION.md](./docs/INITIALIZATION.md).

## 1. Invariants — never violate

- **File I/O**: only via `@agent/core/secure-io`. Never call `node:fs` directly.
- **Missions**: start / checkpoint / finish only via `scripts/mission_controller.ts`. One owner per mission; workers act through task contracts and never mutate mission-wide state directly.
- **Data tiers**: `knowledge/personal/` → `confidential/` → `public/`. Never leak from a higher tier to a lower one. Project scope = `confidential/{project}/`.
- **ADF**: execute only validated contracts (`draft → preflight → auto-repair → commit → execute`). If invalid, dispatch a repair subagent (`validateAndRepairAdf`) first. On failure, classify and repair — never retry a broken contract.
- **Temp files**: `active/shared/tmp/` or mission-local storage only — never ad hoc directories.

## 2. Defaults — do unless there is a clear reason not to

- **Reuse, most-deterministic-first.** Prefer, in order: an existing `pipelines/` pipeline → existing actuators / governed compilers → hand-written ADF → ad-hoc Write/Edit. Check [`pipelines/README.md`](./pipelines/README.md) and [`CAPABILITIES_GUIDE.md`](./CAPABILITIES_GUIDE.md) before improvising; step down a rung only when the one above doesn't fit.
- **Promote repeated deterministic work into a pipeline.** When the same deterministic steps will run again (re-execution likely, or the pattern recurs), capture them as a `pipelines/` pipeline instead of re-improvising — so the next run is replayable and traceable. Keep steps that need fresh model judgment as semantic briefs, not frozen ADF.
- **Delegate heavy or specialized work** (bulk refactor, deep analysis, repair) to subagents via `getReasoningBackend().delegateTask()` to keep the main loop's context small.
- **Mission-gate substantive work.** If a request meets **≥2 of**: (1) 5+ artifacts; (2) external/regulatory audience; (3) re-execution or variants likely; (4) same pattern expected ≥5×; (5) multiple legitimate viewpoints — create a mission + `pipelines/` pipeline instead of going straight to Write/Edit. Customer-facing governance evidence is **always** mission/pipeline (dog-food rule).
- **Reasoning backend**: prefer `KYBERION_REASONING_BACKEND=claude-cli` (local `claude` CLI, no API key) → `anthropic` (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) → `stub` (offline/deterministic tests). Divergent-thinking `wisdom:*` ops need a non-stub backend.

## 3. Lifecycle — intent → goal → result

The work loop is: **capture intent → agree on the goal before changing anything (③) → execute (④) → review and learn (⑤).**

**On session start**, run `pnpm pipeline --input pipelines/baseline-check.json` and branch on the report's `status`:

| status | action |
|---|---|
| `needs_recovery` | → ② Recovery |
| `needs_onboarding` | → ① Onboarding |
| `needs_attention` | → ③ Alignment, but surface the failed layer to the user first |
| `all_clear` | → ③ Alignment |
| `fatal_error` | Pipeline itself failed — report to the user and halt; enter no phase until resolved |

1. **Onboarding** — set up environment & identity: `pnpm install → build → surfaces:reconcile → onboard`. → [onboarding.md](./knowledge/product/governance/phases/onboarding.md)
2. **Recovery** — restore prior state, resume from the suspension point. → [recovery.md](./knowledge/product/governance/phases/recovery.md)
3. **Alignment** — interpret intent and agree on goals. No code changes until goals are agreed. → [alignment.md](./knowledge/product/governance/phases/alignment.md)
4. **Execution** — change one thing, test immediately; on a major obstacle, return to ③. → [execution.md](./knowledge/product/governance/phases/execution.md)
5. **Review** — distill learnings (success & failure) into `knowledge/`, clean up temp files, auto-generate Trace-based hints for future runs. → [review.md](./knowledge/product/governance/phases/review.md)
