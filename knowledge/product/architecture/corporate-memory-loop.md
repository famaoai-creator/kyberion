# Corporate Memory Loop

## 1. Purpose

An enterprise operating kernel must do more than execute work.
It must improve the organization's memory over time.

The corporate memory loop defines how completed work becomes reusable organizational capability.

## 2. Core Loop

```text
Execute
-> Capture
-> Assess
-> Distill
-> Promote
-> Reuse
```

This is the learning half of the enterprise operating model.

## 3. Stages

### 3.1 Execute

Work is performed through:

- task sessions
- missions
- controlled service interactions
- governed artifact production

### 3.2 Capture

The system should retain:

- produced artifacts
- evidence
- traceability references
- approvals
- source context
- execution summaries

This stage is about preserving enough material for later explanation and improvement.

### 3.3 Distill

The system should extract reusable understanding such as:

- what pattern worked
- what failed
- what caused delay
- what template should be reused
- what guardrail should be strengthened

Distillation should prefer structured records over raw log accumulation.

### 3.4 Assess

Not every completed execution should become a candidate.

Before distillation, Kyberion should run a deterministic assessment that checks whether the output is actually reusable.

Examples:

- browser workflows need a trace, an interactive apply step, and a concrete target
- task sessions need a governed artifact and a reusable structure
- generic completions should remain as execution records only

Assessment is a gate, not a memory object.

### 3.5 Promote

Useful learning should be promoted into governed memory forms such as:

- SOP entries
- role guides
- project patterns
- reusable plan templates
- standard intents
- evidence-backed operational hints

High-impact changes may require explicit human ratification.

### 3.6 Reuse

Future resolution and planning should draw on:

- proven patterns
- prior project outcomes
- specialist performance history
- learned clarification prompts
- known risk and approval boundaries

This is how Kyberion becomes more capable as an organization works through it.

## 4. Memory Objects

The corporate memory loop should operate over:

- `Artifacts`
- `Evidence`
- `Pattern records`
- `Knowledge cards`
- `Role guidance`
- `SOP candidates`
- `Approval precedents`

Not every completed task should become a permanent rule.
Promotion should remain selective and governed.

## 5. Relationship to Vault and Knowledge

The memory loop spans both general knowledge and governed sensitive memory.

### Public or general reusable memory

Suitable for:

- generic patterns
- operational templates
- non-sensitive reusable procedures

### Vault-backed or sensitive memory

Suitable for:

- approval evidence
- sensitive business precedent
- privileged service details
- high-trust organizational memory

Vault remains the trust boundary for sensitive learning.

## 6. Snapshot vs Durable Store

Kyberion also distinguishes between:

- the **current memory snapshot** used by a running session
- the **durable memory store** that receives updates for later reuse

Snapshot reads should remain stable during a run. Durable writes should be preserved immediately, but they should not force the current session to re-interpret itself mid-turn.

This separation is documented in [`memory-snapshot-protocol.md`](../orchestration/memory-snapshot-protocol.md) and is used by memory-backed resolution flows such as intent-contract learning.

## 7. Design Rules

### 7.1 Logs are not memory

Raw logs alone do not produce organizational learning.
They must be distilled into reusable forms.

### 7.2 Evidence before promotion

Reusable knowledge should be linked back to evidence.
Memory without accountability becomes folklore.

### 7.3 Candidate before promotion

The system should distinguish:

- execution record
- distill candidate
- promoted memory

Those are separate stages.
Promotion should not happen directly from a raw completion unless the governing policy explicitly allows it.

### 7.4 Reuse should improve resolution

The main value of memory is not archival.
It is better future work:

- faster resolution
- better plans
- better approvals
- fewer repeated mistakes

### 7.5 Human ratification for structural change

Changes to high-impact procedures or organizational rules should be reviewable and, where appropriate, approved before promotion.

## 8. Success Criteria

The corporate memory loop succeeds when:

- completed work improves future work
- recurring requests become easier to resolve
- repeated failures produce explicit guardrails
- successful patterns become reusable templates
- organizational knowledge outlives any single session or operator
